# shape-search

an ai-powered browser that *actually* works — zero fluff, just the best results, fast.

powered by **shapes**: autonomous agents that specialize in different kinds of knowledge, reasoning, and retrieval.

## what it is

shape-search isn't just another search engine. it's a **distributed ai browser** where each shape is an expert agent. you ask a question — they debate, collaborate, and give you the *one* result that matters.

## features

- ai search optimized for *signal, not noise*
- results curated by specialized shape agents
- instant summaries, direct answers, no ad-choked garbage
- visual, minimal ui

## how it works

- each shape = an ai agent w/ a unique retrieval + reasoning strategy
- shapes consult sources, filter junk, and converge on answers
- results are streamed to the user w/ full context

## tech

- next.js + react
- shape api
- vercel deploy
